# Midi-Woush-ServoPlus
Software for Arduino ProMicro/Leonardo/Micro for automatisation on analog synths

One of my projects is a hardware-thing named "Midi-Woush ServoPlus"
It is a electronic based on a cheap Arduino Pro-Micro, together with an 0,96"-OLED-display, four bush-buttons and an DA-Converter.
The hardware is used to spend four analog outputs (0-5V) to give voltages for the automatisation of analog synthesizers like a Behringer Model-D or something vomparable.
It has the ability to drive up to four RC-Servos (normally used in Radiocontrolled planes) to be able to rotate knobs of such a Synthesizer.

I plan a module for delivering voltages with -5V to 5V.
All hardware can be cheaply bough at Ali-Express.
It is still work to do, the drawings for electzronics and 3D-models for casing and Servo-mechanism is still not ready.
